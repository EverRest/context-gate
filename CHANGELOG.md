## Unreleased

### Context firewall (spec 002)

- Classification catalog (`classification`: table, column, class), checked when a contract is loaded.
- `ContextContract` with forms: plain, pseudonym, bucket, date, aggregate, text and one-level relation.
- Contract refusals on load: a column with no class, a `secret` column, and a `personal` column without a pseudonym, aggregate or bucket form.
- Per-tool contract declared as `tools.<name>.contract`; a tool without a contract returns nothing.
- Caller ceiling (`firewall.ceiling`, default `internal`); fields above it are dropped with `ceiling.exceeded`.
- Keyed pseudonyms with session, day or week scope; an unknown or expired pseudonym argument is refused.
- Normalisation before the canary check, so zero-width and compatibility-form variants of a canary are still found.
- Canary values from config (`canaries.values`): a hit in arguments refuses the call, a hit in output returns a failed reference.
- Text fields are wrapped as untrusted and passed through redaction.
- Per-call truncation at a row boundary, per-session and per-day byte budgets, and `calls_per_minute` counted at call entry for visible tools.
- Volume limits are fixed in code for this release; config overrides (`firewall.limits`) and `gate:check` are planned.
- Receipts carry rule hashes (tool, contract, classification) and dropped-field reasons; no field value, pseudonym key or canary value is written.

### 0.1.0-dev: MCP stdio foundation

- `context-gate` MCP server over stdio (`php artisan mcp:start context-gate`), built on `laravel/mcp`.
- Closed-by-default configuration: no tool is visible until enabled, and the tool list is empty by default.
- Hidden and unknown tools share one "not found" response; the reason goes to the receipt only.
- Arguments are validated against the tool schema before the policy and the handler run.
- Tool descriptions are fingerprinted; a changed description hides the tool until it is re-approved.
- Handler failures return `Request failed. Reference: r_...`; the exception text never reaches the caller.
- One metadata-only receipt line per call on the `context-gate` log channel, written to stderr.
- Production refusal: the stdio server does not start when `APP_ENV` is `production`.
- `gate:fingerprint` command prints a tool's description fingerprint.
